- Sup, I’m @PitcherF or Alexy (or Blackfox is either of us are feeling a little edgy)
- I’m interested in a dynamic environemnt for learning and practice, and a community as well
- I also am in search of cool little widgets, extensions, etc. to make life easier
- I’m currently learning JAVA
- I know bare bones C++
